Commit - 72fff926:OneToMany Bidirectional Mapping where @ManyToOne is Owning side and @OneToMany is inverse side.
	OneToMany Bidirectional Mapping - in OneToManyMappingTestRunner we have saved both holdings(vikasH,ashokH) in userVikas but still in DB vikasH is mapped with userVikas and ashokH is mapped with userAshok.Why?
	Because we have used mappedBy property in @OneToMany, we are saying JPA that Holdings is the owning relation and owning relation have higher precedence.So whatever user we put in vikasH,ashokH object using vikasH.setUser(); that mapping is executed instead of mapping from userVikas.setHoldings(list);
	Commenting em.persist(vikasH); and em.persist(ashokH); will not save holdings as  Holdings is owning relation we have to save like this only .Remember user.setHoldings(list) does not do anything as User is not the owning relation in this mapping.
	In next mapping we will see the inconsistency of making @OneToMany as owning relation of mapping.
	what is mappedBy property in @OneToMany - This tells Hibernate that the other side of the association is responsible for managing the relationship, in other words the side where the entity represents the table that contains the foreign key value.Also without mappedBy JPA executes 2 sql queries of insert and update but with it, JPA executes only one insert query.

Commit - 40278e243:Showing Power of Second Level Cache with EhCache provider On Non-Query select statement like entityManager.find() or session.get();
	Enable Second level Cache by doing 2 things.Adding @Cachebale and @Cache on Entity to be cachebale and enabling secondLevel cache by adding 2 properties in app.properties file.
	To Use EhCache we have used EhCacheRegionFactory in app.properties.
	To set custom config of ehCache create ehcache.xml is resource folder from where spring by default reads all properties configuration. See comments if we want to change name of ehcache.xml to something else.
	To demostrate just run the application.We have set maxIdleTime for cache entity to 10sec so change it in Thread.sleep() in SecondLevelCacheRunner.verifySecondLevelCacheAcrossEntityManager()
	In ehcache.xml <defaultCache> element is mandatory & is used when no region is defined.<Cache> element is used for those entities for which region is defined(see User.class).There is another element diskStore which stores caches on harddisk when primary mem. overflows for eg. <diskStore path="java.io.tmpdir/ehcache" />.timeToLiveSeconds attribute is no. of seconds cache waits till it again fetches the cached entity from DB.So in our case Cache will hit DB after 20 seconds and gets updated Data.To prove that hit /list with 20 second of interval from postman.

Commit - 0424c30c: Enabling Query Cache with some imp. points
	Set spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.cache.use_query_cache to true and use .setHint("org.hibernate.cacheable", true) on createQuery("") returnType which is Query on EntityManager.When using Session then set setCacheable(true) on Query.
	Only id's of entities which are returned from cachebale query are stored in cache.
	There is one entry in cache for each parameter binding in query.So query with lots of params are not good for caching.
	Entities that change often are not to be cached as they get evicted from cache on every update
	For each query we can assign custome region name like we assign user region to User class and apply region specific config.
	Native(createNativeQuery) Sql-DML(like update,delete,insert) query should not be used as hibernate does not know which entities got affected and hence it removes everything from second_level_cache.But there is solution for that too. Use nativeQuery.unwrap(org.hibernate.SQLQuery.class).addSynchronizedEntityClass(Foo.class); where nativeQuery is Query object returned by session.createNativeQuery("").
